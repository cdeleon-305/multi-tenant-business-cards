# Multi Tenant React App 

Hello all!

This repo contains a Multi Tenant React App. It is currently in progress and I am explaining each stage in a series of blog posts. 

The following is the list of post currently available and in progress:

- [Part 1: Setup](https://delvalle.dev/posts/multi-tenant-react-app-part-1/multi-tenant-react-app-part-1/)
- [Part 2: Dynamic Routes](https://delvalle.dev/posts/multi-tenant-react-app-part-2/multi-tenant-react-app-part-2/)
- [Part 3: Customizable Components](https://delvalle.dev/posts/multi-tenant-react-app-part-3/multi-tenant-react-app-part-3/)

If you want to run this app just clone the repo, install both the server and client dependencies and run each separately. More info on this in the first post.
